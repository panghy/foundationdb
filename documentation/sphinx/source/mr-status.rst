Machine-Readable Status
#######################

.. include:: guide-common.rst.inc

FoundationDB provides status information in machine-readable JSON form (in addition to the human-readable form made available by :ref:`the command line interface <cli-status>`). This document explains how to access the machine-readable status, provides guidance for its use, and describes the JSON format used to encode it.

.. _mr-status-key:

Accessing machine-readable status
=================================

You can access machine-readable status in three ways ways:

* Within ``fdbcli``, issue the command ``status json``. This command will output status information in JSON (rather than the human-readable format output by ``status`` and ``status details``). See the :ref:`cli-status` command for more information.
* From a command shell, use fdbcli by running ``fdbcli --exec "status json"``
* From any client, read the key ``\xFF\xFF/status/json``. The value of this key is a JSON object serialized to a byte string with UTF-8 encoding. In Python, given an open database ``db``, the JSON object can be read and deserialized with::

    import json
    status = json.loads(db['\xff\xff/status/json'])

Guidance regarding versioning
=============================

The JSON format of the machine-readable status is not considered part of our API and, in particular, is not governed by the :ref:`versioning mechanism <api-python-versioning>` used to facilitate API upgrades. A client that makes use of the machine-readable status should be prepared to handle possible format changes across versions.

Format changes will be governed as follows:

* We will not make arbitrary changes to the JSON format; we will make such changes only as required by changes in the underlying system characteristics relevant to status reporting.
* We may add fields as needed to report new categories of data.
* We may remove a field if a new version of FoundationDB renders the field obsolete.
* We will *not* change the semantics of an existing field. If the data relating to a field changes in a manner that is incompatible with previous usage, the field will be deleted and replaced by a newly named field.

JSON format
===========

The following format informally describes the JSON containing the status data. The possible values of ``<name_string>`` and ``<description_string>`` are described in :ref:`mr-status-message`. The format is representative: *any field can be missing at any time*, depending on the database state. Clients should be prepared to flexibly handle format variations resulting from different database states.

Message components
------------------

Several fields in the JSON object may contain messages in the format:

.. code-block:: javascript

    "messages": [
      {
        "name": <name_string>,
        "description": <description_string>
      }
    ]

Each message is an Object having at least a ``"name"`` field.  The ``"description"`` is present only in some messages.  Other fields may be present based on specific message instance details.  The possible name and description values of a message found at a given location in the JSON object are described in the tables below.
